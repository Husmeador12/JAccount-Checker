# LoLAccountChecker

This tool will give you some information about your league of legends accounts and store them in a text file.

### How to use:
To add accounts, open the Accounts window and from there you can add a single account or import a text file with your account's username and password line-by-line in the following format:
``
username:password
``

Then, click on **Start** to start checking. Your account's should start appearing in the table, if not, verify the Accounts window to see the state of the account. You can stop whenever you want, and click **Start** again if you wanna resume.
 
You can also import and export checked accounts that you want to see later.

### Requirements:

 * [PvPNetConnect](https://github.com/madk/PVPNetConnect)

### Export
You can export your accounts to a JSON file (this way you can import it later), or by creating your own layout. Check [Custom Export](https://github.com/madk/LoLAccountChecker/blob/master/Custom%20Export.md) to see the variables and some examples.


### Reupload
The reason i'm reuploading this projects it's because people are selling it to others, this is a free open-source tool, i'm not going to change anything, the only thing i will probably update is the changes that are required between patches.
